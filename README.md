## 🚀 Features

- 🍎 **100% Native Apple Silicon**: Powered natively by Metal and Swift. 
- 🔌 **OpenAI-compatible**: Drop-in replacement for OpenAI SDKs (`/v1/chat/completions`, streaming, etc).
- 🧠 **Smart Model Routing**: Loads HuggingFace format models directly, with native Safetensors parsing.
- ⚡️ **TurboQuantization Integrated**: Custom low-level MLX Metal primitives that apply extremely fast quantization for KV caching out-of-the-box.
- 💾 **SSD Expert Streaming**: *Experimental* zero-copy streaming that swaps Mixture of Experts (MoE) layers directly from the NVMe SSD to the GPU command buffer without trashing macOS Unified Memory (prevents Watchdog OS kernel panics on 122B+ models).
- 🎛️ **Granular Memory Control**: Integrated Layer Partitioning (`--gpu-layers`) and Wisdom Auto-Calibration for squeezing massive models into RAM.

## ⚡️ TurboQuantization: KV Cache Compression

`SwiftLM` implements a **hybrid V2+V3 TurboQuant architecture** for on-the-fly KV cache compression. At roughly ~3.6 bits per coordinate overall, the KV cache is compressed ~3.5× vs FP16 with near-zero accuracy loss.

### By combining V2 Speed with V3 Quality:
Recent reproductions of the TurboQuant algorithm (e.g., `turboquant-mlx`) revealed two distinct paths:
1. **V2 (Hardware-Accelerated)**: Fast, but uses linear affine quantization which degrades quality at 3-bit.
2. **V3 (Paper-Correct)**: Excellent quality using non-linear Lloyd-Max codebooks, but painfully slow due to software dequantization.

**We built the "Holy Grail" hybrid:** We ported the V3 non-linear Lloyd-Max codebooks directly into the native C++ encoding path, and process the dequantization natively in fused Metal (`bggml-metal`) shaders. This achieves **V3 quality at V2 speeds**, completely detached from Python overhead.

### The Algorithm:

**K-Cache (3-bit PolarQuant + 1-bit QJL) = 4.25 bits/dim**
1. Extract L2 norm and normalize: `x̂ = x / ‖x‖`
2. Apply Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) rotation to distribute outliers evenly.
3. Quantize each coordinate using **3-bit non-linear Lloyd-Max centroids**.
4. Compute the residual error between the original vector and the quantized approximation.
5. Project the residual via a random Johnson-Lindenstrauss (QJL) matrix and store the 1-bit signs.
*(Why QJL? QJL acts as an additional regularizer that prevents centroid resolution loss from degrading the attention dot-product.)*

**V-Cache (3-bit PolarQuant) = 3.125 bits/dim**
Because the V-cache matrix is not used for inner-product attention scoring, the QJL error correction provides no benefit. We cleanly disable QJL for the V-cache, extracting an additional 25% memory savings without sacrificing quality.

## 💻 Benchmarks & Testing

Run our automated benchmark suites via the interactive script:
```bash
./run_benchmark.sh
```

The script provides an interactive menu to select any model and run one of two automated testing suites:

### Test 1: Automated Context & Memory Profile (TPS & RAM matrix)
Tests generation speed (TPS) and granular Apple Metal GPU memory allocation across extreme context lengths (e.g., `512, 40000, 100000` tokens).
- Iterates over 4 configurations: Vanilla, SSD Streaming, TurboQuant, and SSD + TurboQuant.
- Generates a rich ANSI console visualization with bar charts and a configuration scoreboard.
- Saves the complete results matrix to `profiling_results_<hostname>.md`.

### Test 2: Prompt Cache & Sliding Window Regression Test
Verifies the stability of the engine's KV prompt cache when interleaving long contexts with sliding window attention bounds.
- Automatically spins up an isolated background inference server instance.
- Generates a 5,000+ token mock JSON payload.
- Fires an extreme alternating sequence of 4 concurrent requests (`5537t` → `18t` → `5537t` → `Big Full Cache Hit`).
- Confirms the memory bounds remain stable without throwing $O(N^2)$ OS memory warnings, $OOM$ exceptions, or `SIGTRAP` errors.

### Throughput & Inference Memory Profile
Tested by rendering exactly 20 tokens under standard conversational evaluation (`--prefill-size 512`) to capture precise Token Generation (TPS) and Apple Metal memory footprint limits:

| Model | Time To First Token (s) | Generation Speed (tok/s) | Peak GPU Memory (GB) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gemma-4-e2b-it-4bit` | 0.08s | 116.27 tok/s | 1.37 GB |
| `gemma-4-e4b-it-8bit` | 0.33s | 48.21 tok/s | 7.64 GB |
| `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-4bit` | 0.14s | 85.49 tok/s | 13.46 GB |
| `gemma-4-31b-it-4bit` | 0.55s | 14.82 tok/s | 16.83 GB |

To run the automated suite on your machine for these models, execute:
```bash
python3 tests/run_4models_benchmark.py
```

> **🧠 How it works:** SwiftLM implements **Chunked Prefill** (controlled via `--prefill-size`, defaulting to 512). This is functionally equivalent to `llama.cpp`'s `--batch-size` parameter and mirrors the [`mlx-lm` Python library](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/tree/main/mlx_lm)'s reference implementation approach to preventing $O(N^2)$ Unified Memory over-allocation during massive sequence parsing.

> **⚠️ Quantization Disclaimer**: While heavier quantization shrinks the required memory footprint, **4-bit quantization** remains the strict production standard for MoE models. Our metrics indicated that aggressive 2-bit quantization heavily destabilizes JSON grammars—routinely producing broken keys like `\name\` instead of `"name"`—which systematically breaks OpenAI-compatible tool calling.

### Build & Run (iOS)

```bash

## 🛠️ Quick Start (macOS Server)

### Fastest: Download Pre-built Binary

Download the latest release tarball from the [Releases page](https://github.com/SharpAI/SwiftLM/releases).
The archive is **self-contained** — `mlx.metallib` is bundled alongside the binary.

```bash
tar -xzf SwiftLM-<version>-macos-arm64.tar.gz
./SwiftLM --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-4bit --port 5413
```

> **⚠️ Metal GPU Error?** If you see `Failed to load the default metallib`, make sure `mlx.metallib` is co-located with the `SwiftLM` binary.

### Build from Source

The build script handles everything: submodules, cmake, Metal kernel compilation, and the Swift build.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SharpAI/SwiftLM
cd SwiftLM
./build.sh
```

This will:
1. Initialize git submodules
2. Install `cmake` via Homebrew (if not already installed)
3. Compile `mlx.metallib` from the Metal kernel sources
4. Build the `SwiftLM` binary in release mode

Then run:
```bash
.build/release/SwiftLM \
  --model mlx-community/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-4bit \
  --stream-experts \
  --port 5413
```

*(Add `--stream-experts` when running oversized MoE models like Qwen3.5 122B to bypass macOS virtual memory swapping and stream expert layers directly from NVMe.)*

## 📖 The "Aha!" Moment

**The "2+2=4" Aha Moment**: During development, we encountered a severe "silent failure" where the model would successfully load and evaluate all 32 layers at high speed, but generate nothing but infinite whitespace. The model logits showed the correct *shape* but the wrong *magnitudes*. 

The breakthrough arrived when we realized the **embedding scale** was missing. The Gemma architecture requires scaling embedding outputs by `sqrt(hidden_size)`. For a hidden size of 2816, missing this meant every activation in the network was ~53x too small! By adding one single math operation:
`h = h * MLXArray(Float(config.hiddenSize).squareRoot())`

The model instantly woke up from "whispering" whitespace and successfully responded to `"What is 2+2?"` with a perfect `"2 + 2 equals 4."` — proving that the entire massive structural pipeline from Swift to Metal was working.

### 🙏 TurboQuant Credits

The TurboQuant KV cache compression implemented in `SwiftLM` is directly based on the following open-source work and research:

- **[TheTom/llama-cpp-turboquant](https://github.com/TheTom/llama-cpp-turboquant/tree/feature/turboquant-kv-cache)** — The primary reference for the C and Metal GPU implementation. The `turbo-wht.h` Fast Walsh-Hadamard kernel, WHT sign arrays (seed=42), Lloyd-Max centroid tables, and the `ggml-turbo-quant.c` quantize/dequantize logic were ported directly from this repository into our MLX C++ and Metal backend.

- **[TheTom/turboquant_plus](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus)** — Python reference implementation used to validate the algorithm math, codebook construction (Lloyd's algorithm for N(0, 1/d)), and KV cache integration design.

- **TurboQuant Paper** — *"TurboQuant: Online Vector Quantization with Near-optimal Distortion Rate"*, Zandieh et al., AISTATS/ICLR 2026. The two-stage PolarQuant + QJL algorithm described in Section 3 and Appendix A is the mathematical foundation of this implementation.

- **[amirzandieh/QJL](https://github.com/amirzandieh/QJL)** — Original Quantized Johnson-Lindenstrauss (QJL) 1-bit residual correction implementation by the paper authors.
